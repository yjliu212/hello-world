<p><h2>Author: Yangjun (Kevin) Liu</h2></p>
<p></p>
<p><h3>Chapter 1: Introduction</h3></p>
<p><strong>Overview of Rock Physics and Its Importance in Geophysics</strong></p>
<p>Rock physics forms the cornerstone of quantitative seismic interpretation by linking the elastic properties of rocks to their physical and geological characteristics. This field blends principles from geophysics, geology, and engineering to understand how the mineral composition, pore fluids, and pressure-temperature conditions affect seismic velocities and other elastic properties of rocks. By building these relationships, rock physicists can predict how rocks respond to stress and deformation, ultimately helping to interpret seismic data more accurately.</p>
<p>In geophysics, rock physics serves as the bridge between seismic observations and subsurface properties. Through the application of rock physics models, geophysicists are able to transform seismic data into meaningful geological interpretations, such as identifying lithology, porosity, pore fluid content, and even stress conditions in the subsurface. This connection is vital for various applications, including hydrocarbon exploration, geothermal energy development, and geomechanics.</p>
<p>Understanding the rock physics behind seismic velocity, density, and elastic moduli enables more informed decisions in reservoir characterization and monitoring. For example, pore pressure prediction, reservoir compaction, and fluid substitution models all rely heavily on rock physics. Moreover, rock physics allows the integration of petrophysical data from well logs with seismic data, further enhancing the reliability of subsurface models.</p>
<p>This chapter lays the foundation for applying Python to rock physics workflows. From basic calculations to advanced seismic data analysis, Python offers an ideal platform for rock physicists to develop, test, and implement models. By automating tasks, visualizing results, and handling large datasets efficiently, Python empowers geoscientists to focus more on interpretation and less on repetitive processes. Throughout this book, we will explore how Python can be leveraged to build and apply rock physics models, making seismic interpretation more accessible and efficient.</p>

<p><h4>Setting Up a Simple Python Environment for Rock Physics Modeling</h4></p>
<p>Before diving into advanced rock physics models, it’s essential to set up a Python environment that includes the necessary libraries for scientific computing, data manipulation, and visualization. In this section, we’ll walk through the process of setting up a basic Python environment for rock physics modeling and provide a simple code example to get started.</p>
<p><h4>Installing Python and Key Libraries</h4></p>
<p>To get started with Python, you will first need to install Python itself along with the necessary libraries. One of the easiest ways to do this is by using a Python distribution like Anaconda, which is particularly well-suited for scientific computing and data analysis. Anaconda comes pre-installed with many essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy, so you can begin coding without worrying about manually installing these packages. Additionally, Anaconda includes Jupyter Notebooks, which provides an interactive environment for running Python code, making it a popular choice among scientists and engineers.</p>
<p>For users on iPad and iPhone, Carnets is a great option for running Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment directly on your device. This app allows you to write and run Python code without the need for an internet connection, and it leverages iCloud to sync your files across all your Apple devices, making it convenient for on-the-go development. However, one drawback of Carnets is that not all Python libraries are pre-installed. For instance, libraries like SciPy and Pandas may need to be manually installed, which can be a bit tricky on iOS devices due to limitations in file management and package handling.</p>
<p>If you prefer cloud-based computation, Google Colab offers a powerful alternative. Google Colab allows you to run Python code in a Jupyter Notebook environment directly in your web browser. One of the biggest advantages is that it comes with most Python libraries pre-installed, including popular ones like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Since Colab runs entirely online, your projects can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, and all computations are done in the cloud, saving you from the need for local resources. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly with Google Drive, making it easy to manage and store your files.</p>
<p>Each option has its pros and cons, so your choice will depend on your specific needs—whether it's portability, ease of setup, or access to a broader range of libraries.</p>
<p>Here are the key libraries we’ll be using throughout this book:</p>
<p>•	NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.</p>
<p>•	Matplotlib: For plotting and visualization.</p>
<p>•	Pandas: For data manipulation and handling well log data.</p>
<p>•	SciPy: For additional scientific functions, like interpolation and optimization.</p>
<p>To work effectively with Python for scientific computing and data analysis, it's important to ensure that key libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and SciPy are available in your Python environment. These libraries form the foundation of most computational tasks, and checking whether they are installed and available is a crucial first step before starting any project.</p>
<p><h4>Checking if Libraries are Available in Your Python Environment</h4></p>
<p>To check if these libraries are available in your Python environment, you can use the following commands within a Python session or a Jupyter Notebook. Simply try importing the libraries:</p>
<p></p>
<p>import numpy as np</p>
<p>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</p>
<p>import pandas as pd</p>
<p>import scipy</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the libraries are installed, the above commands will run without errors. However, if any of the libraries are missing, Python will raise an ImportError or ModuleNotFoundError. This means the library is not available in your environment, and you’ll need to install it.</p>
<p><h4>Installing Libraries in Your Python Environment</h4></p>
<p>If any of the required libraries are not installed, you can easily install them using pip, Python’s package installer. You can run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt to install each library:</p>
<p></p>
<p>pip install numpy</p>
<p>pip install matplotlib</p>
<p>pip install pandas</p>
<p>pip install scipy</p>
<p>Verifying Installation</p>
<p>After installation, you can verify that the libraries are successfully installed by re-running the import commands. If no errors are raised, the libraries are ready to use.</p>
<p><h4>Importing Libraries into Your Python Program</h4></p>
<p>Once the libraries are installed, you need to import them into your Python program at the beginning of your scripts or Jupyter Notebooks. Here's an example of how to import the libraries:</p>
<p></p>
<p>import numpy as np        # Import NumPy for numerical operations</p>
<p>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Import Matplotlib for plotting</p>
<p>import pandas as pd       # Import Pandas for data manipulation</p>
<p>import scipy              # Import SciPy for scientific functions</p>
<p></p>
<p><h4>Alternative Methods of Installation</h4></p>
<p>If you’re using Google Colab or Carnets (for iOS), the libraries may already be available. In Google Colab, most libraries come pre-installed, but if any are missing, you can install them using pip within the notebook:</p>
<p></p>
<p>!pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scipy</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Carnets, you may need to manually install some libraries if they are not included by default. Unfortunately, installing new packages in Carnets is not as straightforward as in desktop environments, so if you encounter this issue, you may want to consider alternative environments like Anaconda or Google Colab for more complex tasks.</p>
<p>By ensuring these key libraries are available and properly installed, you will be able to smoothly execute numerical computations, data manipulation, and visualization tasks throughout this book.</p>
